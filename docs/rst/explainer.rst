Explainer
=========
ArgumentativeExplainers support multiple frameworks, which can be switched at runtime. The first framework attached to the explainer will be used as default. 
Different frameworks can be useful if we want to explain the same decision to different types of users, with different levels of expertise: one could be to explain a decision to a game playing user, another for debugging purposes for the search tree developer.
